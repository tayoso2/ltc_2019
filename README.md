# Lower Thames Crossing

**Project Description**

Legacy Seams developed a flexible pavement model using World Bankâ€™s HDM-4 Methodology for feasibility study of the Lower Thames Crossing project using R, EDA and Qlik to provide investment planning solutions over a 30 year period. This also involved engineering a non-pavement model as part of whole life cost modelling for the proposed road network. The work done was presented to the client during the demo in April 2020 alongside a demo of the asset deterioration calculator tool.

The project was majorly done using EDA.



**Status**

The feedback from LTC was to make the model more in line with tunnels using data from the A303 tunnel project. We were told we would get some sample data to work with afterwards (though there was a limited time frame to get the work over the line) but we prodded and got no data.

As at June 2020, which was the last correspondence with the client, we were waiting for the A303 data after the most recent meeting on the 1st of June. The client mentioned we should work around a solution using this as at the time we did a demo with the Dashboard created in April. However, we were informed that we have a limited time frame to get this over the line but the data never got sent to us.
